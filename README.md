# TemplateEngine - Homework 10

In this homeowrk assignment, we were tasked in building a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generate and HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. You will be able to add new members to the summary page as you grow your team. I was able to implement testing with the use of Jest to ensure all unit tests pass. 

##Installation

Run ```bash NPM install``` to get all the necessary modules. Ensure that Jest is installed.
